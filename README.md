# Ripelines

This is meant to be a framework similar to gstreamer but in Rust.

Mainly used as a learning exercise to write some Rust and also since I work in Gstreamer so much, to learn it more by implementing my own version and understanding design tradeoffs, how they do things by reading through Gstreamer source as I come into similar issues, and just for fun!
